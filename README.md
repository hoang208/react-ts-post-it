# Typescript Next.JS Post It Board:

## Description

_Duration: 6 hour Sprint_

Over the course of two, the goal was to create a functional full-stack web based application using Typscript, Next.JS, and Tailwind.CSS. The project served as an introduction to me on how to use these three programs. The web based application is a post it note board for users to keep track of anything they want to write down.
